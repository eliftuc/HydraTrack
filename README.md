# Elif's H2O Journey / HydraTrack

This project is a web-based application designed to track daily water intake. Users can set a water consumption goal, track their intake using +100 ml / -100 ml buttons, and log their daily progress. The app visualizes past water intake data to help users monitor their hydration habits.

## Features

- **User Goal**: Users can set their daily water intake goal.
- **Water Consumption Tracking**: Users can record their intake by clicking the +100 ml / -100 ml buttons to increase or decrease the water consumption.
- **Daily Progress**: Daily water intake data is logged and displayed to the user.
- **Past Data**: Previous days' water consumption data can be viewed.
- **Celebration Message**: A congratulatory message appears when the user reaches their water intake goal.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for animations and dynamic interactions)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask framework)
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing user and daily water intake data)
